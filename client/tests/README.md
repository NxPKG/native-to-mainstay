### Running tests

- **IMPORTANT:** Make sure all programs that are in tests are deployed in your local validator and they are up-to date.
- Make sure to update program ids in `src/constants.ts` if needed.

Initialize packages with:

```sh
# in client directory
sh build-packages.sh
```

Run:

```sh
# in client/tests
yarn test
```

**NOTE:** Tests are for whether we are successfully able to call programs with Mainstay and fetch state, and not for whether program logic works as intended.
